      org.freedesktop.portal.MemoryMonitor:
      @short_description: Memory monitoring portal

      The Memory Monitor interface provides information about low system
      memory to sandboxed applications. It is not a portal in the strict
      sense, since it does not involve user interaction. Applications are
      expected to use this interface indirectly, via a library API
      such as the GLib GMemoryMonitor interface.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
