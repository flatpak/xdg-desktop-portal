      org.freedesktop.portal.Background:
      @short_description: Portal for requesting autostart and background activity 

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications request that the
      application is allowed to run in the background. If the application installs
      an autostart file, it will be used to run the application when the user
      logs in.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
