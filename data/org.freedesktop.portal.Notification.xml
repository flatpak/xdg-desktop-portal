      org.freedesktop.portal.Notification:
      @short_description: Portal for sending notifications

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications send and withdraw
      notifications. It is not possible for the application to learn
      if the notification was actually presented to the user. Not a
      portal in the strict sense, since there is no user interaction.

      Note that in contrast to most other portal requests, notifications
      are expected to outlast the running application. If a user clicks
      on a notification after the application has exited, it will get
      activated again.

      Notifications can specify actions that can be activated by the
      user. Actions whose name starts with 'app.' are assumed to be
      exported and will be activated via the ActivateAction()
      method in the org.freedesktop.Application interface. Other
      actions are activated by sending the
      #org.freedeskop.portal.Notification::ActionInvoked signal
      to the application.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Notification">
    <!--
        AddNotification:
        @id: Application-provided ID for this notification
        @notification: Vardict with the serialized notification

        Sends a notification.

        The ID can be used to later withdraw the notification.
        If the application reuses the same ID without withdrawing,
        the notification is replaced by the new one.

        The format of the serialized notification is a vardict, with
        the following supported keys, all of which are optional:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>title s</term>
            <listitem><para>
              User-visible string to display as the title.

        The format for serialized buttons is a vardict with the following supported keys:
