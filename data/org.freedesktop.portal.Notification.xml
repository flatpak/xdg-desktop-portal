      org.freedesktop.portal.Notification:
      @short_description: Portal for sending notifications

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications send and withdraw
      notifications. It is not possible for the application to learn
      if the notification was actually presented to the user. Not a
      portal in the strict sense, since there is no user interaction.

      Note that in contrast to most other portal requests, notifications
      are expected to outlast the running application. If a user clicks
      on a notification after the application has exited, it will get
      activated again.

      Notifications can specify actions that can be activated by the
      user. Actions whose name starts with 'app.' are assumed to be
      exported and will be activated via the ActivateAction()
      method in the org.freedesktop.Application interface. Other
      actions are activated by sending the
      #org.freedesktop.portal.Notification::ActionInvoked signal
      to the application.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Notification">
    <!--
        AddNotification:
        @id: Application-provided ID for this notification
        @notification: Vardict with the serialized notification

        Sends a notification.

        The ID can be used to later withdraw the notification.
        If the application reuses the same ID without withdrawing,
        the notification is replaced by the new one.

        The format of the serialized notification is a vardict, with
        the following supported keys, all of which are optional:

        * ``title`` (``s``)

          User-visible string to display as the title.

        * ``body`` (``s``)

          User-visible string to display as the body.

        * ``icon`` (``v``)

          Serialized icon (see `g_icon_serialize()
          <https://docs.gtk.org/gio/method.Icon.serialize.html>`_).

          The portal only accepts serialized GThemedIcon and GBytesIcons. Both of
          these have the form (sv). For themed icons, the string is "themed",
          and the value is an array of strings containing the icon names.
          For bytes icons, the string is "bytes", and the value is a bytestring
          containing the icon data in png, jpeg or svg form. For historical
          reasons, it is also possible to send a simple string for themed
          icons with a single icon name.

          There may be further restrictions on the supported kinds of icons.

        * ``priority`` (``s``)

          The priority for the notification. Supported values:

          - ``low``
          - ``normal``
          - ``high``
          - ``urgent``

        * ``default-action`` (``s``)

          Name of an action that is exported by the application. This
          action will be activated when the user clicks on the notification.

        * ``default-action-target`` (``v``)

          Target parameter to send along when activating the default action.

        * ``buttons`` (``aa{sv}``)

          Array of serialized buttons to add to the notification. The format for
          serialized buttons is a vardict with the following supported keys:

          * ``label`` (``s``)

            User-visible label for the button. Mandatory.

          * ``action`` (``s``)

            Name of an action that is exported by the application. The action
            will be activated when the user clicks on the button. Mandatory.

          * ``target`` (``v``)

            Target parameter to send along when activating the action.
