      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.DynamicLauncher:
      @short_description: Dynamic launcher portal backend interface

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.DynamicLauncher">
    <!--
        PrepareInstall:
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request` object representing this call
        @app_id: App id of the application
        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window, see :doc:`window-identifiers`
        @name: The default name for the launcher
        @icon_v: A #GBytesIcon as returned by g_icon_serialize()
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @response: Numeric response (0 == success)
        @results: Vardict with the results of the call

        Presents a dialog to the user to allow them to see the icon, potentially
        change the name, and confirm installation of the launcher.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict:

        * ``modal`` (``b``)

          Whether to make the dialog modal. Defaults to yes.

        * ``launcher_type`` (``u``)

          The type of launcher being created. For supported values see the
          SupportedLauncherTypes property. Defaults to "Application".

        * ``target`` (``s``)

          For a launcher of type "Webapp", this is the URL of the web app
          being installed. This is displayed in the user-facing dialog.
          For other launcher types, this is not needed.

        * ``editable_name`` (``b``)

          If true, the user will be able to edit the name of the launcher.
          Defaults to true.

        * ``editable_icon`` (``b``)

          If true, the user will be able to edit the icon of the launcher,
          if the implementation supports this. Defaults to false.

        The following results get returned via the @results vardict:

        * ``name`` (``s``)

          The name chosen by the user for the launcher (or the default if
          the editable_name option was false).

        * ``icon`` (``v``)

          The icon chosen by the user for the launcher (or the default if
          the ``editable_icon`` option was false).

        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @response: 0 if the caller should be allowed to do non-interactive launcher installation, a nonzero number otherwise

        The @response returned by this method is used to determine whether to
        give an install token to the caller, which can be used to avoid the need
        for a confirmation dialog; the token can be passed to the
        :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.Install` method just as if it
        were acquired via the
        :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.PrepareInstall` method.

        It is up to the portal implementation to decide whether this method is
        allowed based on the @app_id of the caller.

        The @options vardict currently has no supported entries.
