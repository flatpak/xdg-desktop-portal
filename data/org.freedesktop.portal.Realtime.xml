      org.freedesktop.portal.Realtime:
      @short_description: Portal for setting threads to realtime

      Interface for setting a thread to realtime from within the
      sandbox. It is analogous to the org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1
      interface and will proxy requests there but with pid mapping.
      The latter is necessary in the case that sandbox has pid namespace
      isolation enabled.

      Note that this proxy does not bypass any limitations that
      RealtimeKit imposes on processes which are documented here:
      https://git.0pointer.net/rtkit.git/tree/README

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
