       @short_description: Portal for opening URIs

       The OpenURI portal allows sandboxed applications to open
       URIs (e.g. a http: link to the applications homepage)
       under the control of the user.

        OpenURI:
        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window
        @uri: The uri to open
        @options: Vardict with optional further onformation
        @handle: Object path for the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request object representing this call

        Asks to open a uri.

        The @parent_window identifier must be of the form "x11:$XID" for an X11
        window. Support for other window systems may be added in the future.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>writable b</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Whether to allow the chosen application to write to the file.
            </para><para>
              This key only takes effect the uri points to a local file that
              is exported in the document portal, and the chosen application
              is sandboxed itself.
