      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.AppChooser:
      @short_description: Interface for choosing an application

      This backend can be used by portal implementations that
      need to choose an application from a list of applications.

      This documentation describes version 2 of this interface.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.AppChooser">
    <!--
        ChooseApplication:
        @handle: Object path to export the Request object at
        @app_id: App id of the application
        @title: Title for the app chooser dialog
        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window, see :doc:`window-identifiers`
        @choices: App ids of applications to let the user choose from
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @response: Numeric response
        @results: Vardict with the results of the call

        Presents a list of applications to the user to choose one.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``last_choice`` (``s``)

          The app id that was selected the last time.

        * ``modal`` (``b``)

          Whether to make the dialog modal. Defaults to yes.

        * ``content_type`` (``s``)

          The content type to choose an application for.

        * ``uri`` (``s``)

          The uri to choose an application for.

        * ``filename`` (``s``)

          The filename to choose an application for. Note that this is just a
          basename, without a path.

        * ``activation_token`` (``s``)

          A token that can be used to activate the application chooser.

          The activation_token option was introduced in version 2 of the interface.

        The following results get returned via the @results vardict:

        * ``choice`` (``s``)

          The app id that was selected.

        * ``activation_token`` (``s``)

          A token that can be used to activate the chosen application. If
          the application selection has involved user interaction, a new
          token should be generated by the portal implementation.
          Otherwise, this token may be the same as the one passed in
          @options.

          The activation_token option was introduced in version 2 of the interface.
