      org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot:
      @short_description: portal for taking screenshots

      This simple portal lets sandboxed applications request a screenshot.

      The screenshot will be made accessible to the application
      via the document portal, and the returned URI will point
      into the document portal fuse filesystem in /run/user/$UID/doc/.
