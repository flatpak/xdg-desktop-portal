      org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot:
      @short_description: Portal for taking screenshots

      This simple portal lets sandboxed applications request a screenshot.

      The screenshot will be made accessible to the application (which
      may involve adding it to the :ref:`Documents
      portal<org.freedesktop.portal.Documents>`).

      This documentation describes **version 3** of this interface.

    <!--
        Screenshot:
        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window, see :ref:`Common Conventions`</link>
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

        Takes a screenshot.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.

        * ``modal`` (``b``)

          Whether the dialog should be modal. Default is yes.

        * ``interactive`` (``b``)

          Hint whether the dialog should offer customization before taking a screenshot.
          Default is no.  **Since version 2.**

        * ``type`` (``u``)

          Hints what type of screenshot should be taken. May preselect the type if combined with interactive.
          Default is 0. Accepted values are:

          - ``0``: Entire screen (default)
          - ``1``: A window to be selected by the user
          - ``2``: An area to be selected by the user

          **Since version 3.**

        The following results get returned via the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response`
        signal:

        * ``uri`` (``s``)

          String containing the uri of the screenshot.
