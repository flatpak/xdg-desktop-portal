      org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot:
      @short_description: Portal for taking screenshots

      This simple portal lets sandboxed applications request a screenshot.

      The screenshot will be made accessible to the application
      via the document portal, and the returned URI will point
      into the document portal fuse filesystem in /run/user/$UID/doc/.

        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request object representing this call

        Takes a screenshot.

        The @parent_window identifier must be of the form "x11:$XID" for an X11
        window. Support for other window systems may be added in the future.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>modal b</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Whether the dialog should be modal. Default is not.
            </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        The following results get returned via the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response signal:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>uri s</term>
            <listitem><para>String containing the uri of the screenshot.</para></listitem>
