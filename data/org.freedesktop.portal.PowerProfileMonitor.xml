      @short_description: Power Profile monitoring portal

      The Power Profile Monitor interface provides information about the
      user-selected system-wide power profile, to sandboxed applications.
      It is not a portal in the strict sense, since it does not involve
      user interaction. Applications are expected to use this interface
      indirectly, via a library API such as the GLib GPowerProfileMonitor interface.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
