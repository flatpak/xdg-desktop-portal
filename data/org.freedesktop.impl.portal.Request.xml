      @short_description: Shared request interface

      The Request interface is shared by all portal backend interfaces.
      When a backend method is called, the backend exports a Request object
      on the object path that was sent with the method call. The Request
      will stay alive for the duration of the user interaction related to
      the method call.

      The portal can abort the interaction calling
      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request.Close() on the Request object.

    <!--
        Close:

        Ends the user interaction to which this object refers.
        Dialogs and other UIs related to the request should be closed.
