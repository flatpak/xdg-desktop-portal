      org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher:
      @short_description: Portal for installing application launchers onto the
        desktop

      The DynamicLauncher portal allows sandboxed (or unsandboxed) applications
      to install launchers (.desktop files) which have an icon associated with them
      and which execute a command in the application. The desktop environment
      would display the launcher to the user in its menu of installed applications.
      For example this can be used by a sandboxed browser to install web app
      launchers. The portal also allows apps to uninstall the launchers, launch
      them, and read the desktop file and icon data for them.

      The standard way to install a launcher is to use the PrepareInstall() method
      which results in a dialog being presented to the user so they can confirm
      they want to install the launcher. Then, the token returned by PrepareInstall()
      would be passed to the Install() method to complete the installation.

      However, in the rare circumstance that an unsandboxed process such as a
      system component needs to install a launcher without user interaction, this
      can be accomplished by using the RequestInstallToken() method and passing
      the acquired token to Install().

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher">
    <!--
        Install:
        @token: Token proving authorization of the installation
        @desktop_file_id: The .desktop file name to be used
        @desktop_entry: The text of the Desktop Entry file to be installed, see below
        @options: Vardict with optional further information

        Installs a .desktop launcher and icon into appropriate directories to
        allow the desktop environment to find them. Please note that this method
        overwrites any existing launcher with the same id. If you want to
        present the user with a confirmation dialog in that case, you can check
        for it using the GetDesktopEntry() method and clean up any state from
        the previous launcher if you want.

        @token must be a token that was returned by a previous
        org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.PrepareInstall() or
        org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.RequestInstallToken() call.
        The token can only be used once and is valid for up to five minutes.

        The icon and name used for the launcher will be the ones from the previous
        org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.PrepareInstall() or
        org.freedesktop.portal.DynamicLauncher.RequestInstallToken() call.

        The @desktop_file_id must have ".desktop" as a suffix. Except in the
        special case when the calling process has no associated app ID,
        @desktop_file_id must have the app ID followed by a period as a prefix,
        regardless of whether the calling process is sandboxed or unsandboxed.

        The @desktop_entry should be a valid desktop entry file beginning with
        "[Desktop Entry]", except it should not include Name= or Icon= entries
        (if present, these will be overwritten by the portal implementation).
        The Exec= entry will be rewritten to call the sandboxed application e.g.
        via "flatpak run", if the application is sandboxed.

        It is recommended to include a TryExec= line with either a binary name
        or an absolute path. The launcher will be deleted if the TryExec binary
        cannot be found on session start.

        The @options vardict currently has no supported entries.

        Uninstall:
        @desktop_file_id: The .desktop file name
        @options: Vardict with optional further information

        This method deletes the desktop file and corresponding icon from the
        appropriate directories to remove the launcher referred to by
        @desktop_file_id.

        The @desktop_file_id must have ".desktop" as a suffix. Except in the
        special case when the calling process has no associated app ID,
        @desktop_file_id must have the app ID followed by a period as a prefix,
        regardless of whether the calling process is sandboxed or unsandboxed.

        For example, Epiphany, which has the app ID "org.gnome.Epiphany"
        in stable builds, might use a @desktop_file_id like
        "org.gnome.Epiphany.WebApp_e9d0e1e4b0a10856aa3b38d9eb4375de4070d043.desktop"
        In that example the desktop file would exist at the path
        "~/.local/share/xdg-desktop-portal/applications/org.gnome.Epiphany.WebApp_e9d0e1e4b0a10856aa3b38d9eb4375de4070d043.desktop"
        with a sym link in "~/.local/share/applications/".
        The checksum at the end of the file name is an implementation detail in
        Epiphany and not required by the portal.

        This method is intended to be called by the application that created the
        launcher, e.g. a web browser, so it can clean up associated data as part
        of the uninstallation. Consequently, the proper way for a software center
        to remove a launcher is by using the APIs provided by the application
        that installed it. For example, for GNOME Software to remove web
        launchers created by Epiphany, it would use the
        org.gnome.Epiphany.WebAppProvider D-Bus interface.

        Please note that this method call will fail if the specified launcher
        already does not exist.

        The format and size of the icon are returned in @icon_format and
        @icon_size. For svg icons, @icon_size is currently always set to 4096,
