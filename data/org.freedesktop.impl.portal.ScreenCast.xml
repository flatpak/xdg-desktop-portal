      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast:
      @short_description: Screen cast portal backend interface

      The Screen cast portal allows to create screen cast sessions.

      This documentation describes version 5 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast">
    <!--
        CreateSession:
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Request` object representing this call

        @response: Numeric response
        @results: Vardict with the results of the call

        Create a screen cast session.

        The following results get returned in the @results vardict:

        * ``session_id`` (``s``)

          The session id. A string representing the created screen cast session.

        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @response: Numeric response
        @results: Vardict with the results of the call

        Configure what the screen cast session should record.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``types`` (``u``)

          Bitmask of what type of content to record. Default is MONITOR.

        * ``multiple`` (``b``)

          Whether to allow selecting multiple sources. Default is no.

        * ``cursor_mode`` (``u``)

          Determines how the cursor will be drawn in the screen cast stream. It must be
          one of the cursor modes advertised in
          #org.freedesktop.portal.impl.ScreenCast.AvailableCursorModes. Setting a cursor
          mode not advertised will cause the screen cast session to be closed. The default
          cursor mode is 'Hidden'.

          This option was added in version 2 of this interface.

        * ``restore_data`` (``(suv)``)

          The data to restore from a previous session.

          If the stored session cannot be restored, this value is ignored
          and the user will be prompted normally. This may happen when, for
          example, the session contains a monitor or a window that is not
          available anymore, or when the stored permissions are withdrawn.

          The restore data is composed of the vendor name (e.g. "GNOME" or
          "KDE"), the version of the implementation-specific private data,
          and the implementation-specific private data itself.

          This option was added in version 4 of this interface.

        * ``persist_mode`` (``u``)

          How this session should persist. Default is 0. Accepted values are:

          - ``0``: Do not persist (default)
          - ``1``: Permissions persist as long as the application is running
          - ``2``: Permissions persist until explicitly revoked

          If the permission for the session to persist is granted,
          "persist_mode" will be returned in the results of the
          org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast.Start() method.

          This option was added in version 4 of this interface.

        @results: Vardict with the results of the call

        Start the screen cast session. This will typically result the portal presenting
        a dialog letting the user do the selection set up by SelectSources.

        The following results get returned in the @results vardict:

        * ``streams`` (``a(ua{sv})``)

          An array of PipeWire streams. Each stream consists of a PipeWire
          node ID (the first element in the tuple, and a Vardict of
          properties.

          The array will contain a single stream if 'multiple' (see
          SelectSources) was set to 'false', or at least one stream if
          'multiple' was set to 'true' as part of the SelectSources method.

          Each stream constains the following properties:

          * ``position`` (``(ii)``)

            A tuple consisting of the position (x, y) in the compositor
            coordinate space. Note that the position may not be equivalent to a
            position in a pixel coordinate space. Only available for monitor
            streams.

          * ``size`` (``(ii)``)

            A tuple consisting of (width, height). The size represents the size
            of the stream as it is displayed in the compositor coordinate
            space. Note that this size may not be equivalent to a size in a
            pixel coordinate space. The size may differ from the size of the
            stream.

          * ``source_type`` (``u``)

            The type of the content which is being screen casted.
            For available source types, see the AvailableSourceTypes property.

            This property was added in version 3 of this interface.

          * ``mapping_id`` (``s``)

            An optional identifier used to map different aspects of the
            resource this stream corresponds to.

            When used in a remote desktop session, the mapping_id can be used to
            match a libei region of absolute libei devices. There may be
            multiple absolute libei devices, and each device may have multiple
            regions, but a mapping_id will only match one of these regions per
            device.

            This property was added in version 5 of this interface.

        * ``persist_mode`` (``u``)

          Portal implementations can optionally offer ways to "reduce" the
          persist mode, for example by explicitly asking the user. See the
          'persist_mode' option of SelectSources for a list of possible
          values.

          If no persist mode is returned by the Start request, it is assumed
          to be the same persist mode received during SelectSources.

          This option was added in version 4 of this interface.

        * ``restore_data`` (``(suv)``)

          The data to be restored. This is the data that a portal
          implementation sent in reaction to transient or persistent
          modes.

          This data will be stored in the permission store if the effective
          persist mode is 2, and may be passed in the future as part of the
          SelectSources() method call. The portal backend should store enough
          information in 'restore_data' to be able to restore the session
          later. The portal backend can deal with unavailable sources however
          they see fit.

          Data generated by a portal implementation must be consumable by
          the same portal implementation, but not necessarily by others.
          Thus, it is important to properly handle 'restore_data' not being
          in a valid format. This may happen when, e.g., the user switched
          to another desktop environment, or is using a different portal
          implementation.

          This response option was added in version 4 of this interface.
