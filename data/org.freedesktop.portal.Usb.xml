      org.freedesktop.portal.Usb:
      @short_description: Portal for USB device access

      This interface lets sandboxed applications monitor and request
      access to connected USB devices.

      Applications should prefer specialized portals for specific
      device types, such as the Camera portal for cameras.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Usb">

        CreateSession:
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

        Creates an USB monitoring session.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``session_handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the session handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the #org.freedesktop.portal.Session documentation for
          more information about the session handle.

        EnumerateDevices:
        @session_handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session` object
        @options: Vardict with optional further information

        Enumerates all connected USB devices that this application has permission
        to see.

        The following results are returned in the @device vardict:

        * ``id`` (``s``)

          The portal-specific unique identifier of the device.

        * ``parent`` (``s``)

          Device ID of the parent device.

        * ``readable`` (``b``)

          Whether the device can be opened for reading with
          org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.AcquireDevices(). If not present, then
          it should be assumed to be false.

        * ``writable`` (``b``)

          Whether the device can be opened for writing with
          org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.AcquireDevices(). If not present, then
          it should be assumed to be false.

        * ``devnode`` (``s``)

          A string path to the device node inside the /dev filesystem.

        * ``properties`` (``a{sv}``)

          A list of udev properties that this device has. These properties
          are not parsed in any way by the portal, it is up to apps to parse
          them.

          Whether the device will be opened in read-write or read-only mode.

          for more information about the @handle.

        The #org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response signal is emitted without
        any extra information.

        This method can only be called once, and only after calling

          Whether the device access was successful or not.

        * ``fd`` (``h``)

          The file descriptor representing the device. Only present if this
          was a successful device access.

        * ``error`` (``s``)

          Error message describing why accessing the device was not
          successful. Only present if this was an failed device access.

        There are no supported keys in the @options vardict.

        The DeviceEvents signal is emitted when one or more USB devices have
        been added, changed, or removed. This signal is only emitted for active
        sessions created with org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.CreateSession().

        Each element of the @events array is composed of the following fields:

        * ``id`` (``s``)

          Device ID that the event occurred on.

        * ``device`` (``s``)

          Device properties attached to the ID. See
          org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.EnumerateDevices() for a list of all
          the properties that may be present in the vardict.
