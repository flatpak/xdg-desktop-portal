      @short_description: Network monitoring portal

      The NetworkMonitor interface provides network status information
      to sandboxed applications. It is not a portal in the strict sense,
      since it does not involve user interaction. Applications are
      expected to use this interface indirectly, via a library API
      such as the GLib GNetworkMonitor interface.
