      org.freedesktop.host.portal.Registry:
      @short_description: Interface to associate D-Bus peers with application ids

      This simple interface lets unsandboxed applications register their
      D-Bus connections and associate it with an application ID that will be
      used in portals.

      This interface will not work with applications xdg-desktop-portal
      identifies as sandboxed.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.host.portal.Registry">
    <!--
        Register:
        @app_id: Application identifier
        @options: Vardict with optional further information

        Register a D-Bus peer and associate it with an application ID. The
        application ID must be able to match the basename of a .desktop file
        that describes the application.

        The application ID will be used in org.freedesktop.portal APIs to
        associate a portal action with an application.

        Registering can only done at most once; any subsequent call will result
        in an error.

        Registering must be done before any portal method call; registering
        after such a call will result in an error.
