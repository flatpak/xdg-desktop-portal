      org.freedesktop.portal.Account:
      @short_description: Portal for obtaining information about the user

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications query basic
      information about the user, like their name and avatar photo.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Account">
    <!--
        GetUserInformation:
        @window: Identifier for the window
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

        Gets information about the user.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.

        * ``reason`` (``s``)

          A string that can be shown in the dialog to explain why the information is
          needed. This should be a complete sentence that explains what the application
          will do with the returned information, for example: "Allows your personal
          information to be included with recipes you share with your friends".


        The following results get returned via the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response` signal:

        * ``id`` (``s``)

          The user id.

        * ``name`` (``s``)

          The user's real name.

        * ``image`` (``s``)

          The URI of an image file for the user's avatar photo.
