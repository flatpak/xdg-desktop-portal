      org.freedesktop.portal.Email:
      @short_description: Portal for sending email

      This simple portal lets sandboxed applications request to send an email,
      optionally providing an address, subject, body and attachments.

      This documentation describes version 3 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Email">
    <!--
        ComposeEmail:
        @parent_window: Identifier for the application window, see <link linkend="parent_window">Common Conventions</link>
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request object representing this call

        Presents a window that lets the user compose an email.

        Note that the default email client for the host will need to support mailto: URIs
        following <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2368">RFC 2368</ulink>, with
        "cc", "bcc", "subject" and "body" query keys each corresponding to the email
        header of the same name, and with each attachment being passed as a "file://"
        URI as a value in an "attachment" query key.

        For example:
        <programlisting>
        mailto:foo@bar.com,baz@bar.com?cc=ceo@bar.com&amp;subject=Test%20e-mail%20subject&amp;attachment=file://path/to/full/file.txt
        </programlisting>
        would send a mail to "foo@bar.com", "baz@bar.com", with a CC:
        to "ceo@bar.com", with the subject "Test e-mail subject"
        and the file pointed by URI "file://path/to/full/file.txt" as an attachment.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:
        <variablelist>
