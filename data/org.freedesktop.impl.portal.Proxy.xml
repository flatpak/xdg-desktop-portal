      @short_description: Proxy information

      The Proxy interface provides network proxy information to
      xdg-desktop-portal, which then provides this information to sandboxed
      applications.

      All properties are allowed to exist at the same time; however, if pac_url
      exists, other properties shouldn't be utilized without user intervention,
      and aren't guaranteed to exist, or even match what pac_url would be
      equivalent to.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
