        Request to gain access to the camera.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)
          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.

        Following the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response` signal, if
        granted, org.freedesktop.portal.Camera.OpenPipeWireRemote() can be used to
        open a PipeWire remote.

        Open a file descriptor to the PipeWire remote where the camera nodes
        are available. The file descriptor should be used to create a

        This method will only succeed if the application already has permission
