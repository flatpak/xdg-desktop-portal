        RequestClipboard:
        @session_handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session` object
        @options: Vardict with optional further information

        Requests clipboard access for the given portal session. This request
        must be made before the session starts.

        This portal does NOT create it's own session. Instead, it offers existing sessions
        created from other portals the option to integrate with the clipboard. For whether
        this interface is supported for a given session, refer to that portal's documentation.
        See :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.RemoteDesktop` to integrate clipboard with the
        remote desktop session.

        Sets the owner of the clipboard formats in 'mime_types' in @options to
        the session, i.e. this session has data for the advertised clipboard formats.

        See :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.FileTransfer` to transfer files using the

        May only be called if clipboard access was given after starting the session.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``mime_types`` (``as``)

          A list of mime types that the session has clipboard content for.
