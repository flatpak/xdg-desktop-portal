      org.freedesktop.portal.Device:
      @short_description: Portal for device access

      This interface lets services ask if an application should
      get access to devices such as microphones, speakers or cameras.
      Not a portal in the strict sense, since the API is not directly
      accessible to applications inside the sandbox.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.
    -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Device">
    <!--
        AccessDevice:
        @pid: the pid of the application on whose behalf the request is made
        @devices: a list of devices to request access to.
        @options: vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

        Asks for access to a device.

        Supported values for the @devices list are:

        - ``microphone``
        - ``speakers``
        - ``camera``

        Asking for multiple devices at the same time may not be supported, depending on
        the portal implementation.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.
