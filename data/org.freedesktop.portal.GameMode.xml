      org.freedesktop.portal.GameMode:
      @short_description: Portal for accessing GameMode

      Interface for accessing GameMode from within the sandbox. It
      is analogous to the com.feralinteractive.GameMode interface
      and will proxy request there, but with additional permission
      checking and pid mapping. The latter is necessary in the case
      that sandbox has pid  namespace isolation enabled. See the man
      page for pid_namespaces(7) for more details, but briefly, it
      means that the sandbox has its own process id namespace which
      is separated from the one on the host. Thus there will be two
      separate process  ids (pids) within two different namespaces
      that both identify same process. One id from the pid namespace
      inside the sandbox and one id from the host pid namespace.
      Since GameMode expects pids from the host pid namespace but
      programs inside the sandbox can only know pids from the sandbox
      namespace, process ids need to be translated from the portal to
      the host namespace. The portal will do that transparently for
      all calls where this is necessary.

      Note: GameMode will monitor active clients, i.e. games and
      other programs that have successfully called 'RegisterGame'.
      In the event that a client terminates without a call to the
      'UnregisterGame' method, GameMode will automatically un-register
      the client. This might happen with a (small) delay.

      This documentation describes version 3 of this interface.

          Query the GameMode status for a process. If the caller
          is running inside a sandbox with pid namespace isolation,
          the pid will be translated to the respective host pid. See
          the general introduction for details. Will return:

          Un-register a game from GameMode; if the call is successful
          and there are no other games or clients registered, GameMode
          will be deactivated. If the caller is running inside a sandbox
