      org.freedesktop.portal.Request:
      @short_description: shared request interface

      The Request interface is shared by all portal interfaces. When a
      portal method is called, the reply includes a handle (i.e. object path)
      for a Request object, which will stay alive for the duration of the
      user interaction related to the method call.

      The portal indicates that a portal request interaction is over by
      emitting the #org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response signal on the
      Request object.

      The application can abort the interaction calling
      org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Close() on the Request object.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.portal.Request">

    <!--
        Close:

        Ends the portal request and its user interaction (dialogs, etc)
        to which this object refers. A Response signal will not be emitted
        in this case.
    -->
    <method name="Close">
    </method>

    <!--
        Response:
        @response: numeric response
        @results: A vardict with results. The keys and values in the vardict depend on the request.

        Emitted when the user interaction for a portal request is over.

        The @response indicates how the user interaction ended:
            <simplelist>
              <member>0: Success, the request is carried out</member>
              <member>1: The user cancelled the interaction</member>
              <member>2: The user interaction was ended in some other way</member>
            </simplelist>
    -->
    <signal name="Response">
      <arg type="u" name="response"/>
      <arg type="a{sv}" name="results"/>
    </signal>
