      org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit:
      @short_description: Portal for inhibiting session transitions

      This simple interface lets sandboxed applications inhibit the user
      session from ending, suspending, idling or getting switched away.

      This documentation describes version 3 of this interface.

        Inhibit:
        @window: Identifier for the window
        @flags: Flags identifying what is inhibited
        @options: Vardict with optional further information
        @handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` object representing this call

        Inhibits a session status changes. To remove the inhibition,
        call :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request.Close` on the returned
        handle.

        The flags determine what changes are inhibited:

        - ``1``: Logout
        - ``2``: User Switch
        - ``4``: Suspend
        - ``8``: Idle

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.

        * ``reason`` (``s``)

          User-visible reason for the inhibition.

        Creates a monitoring session. While this session is
        active, the caller will receive StateChanged signals
        with updates on the session state.

        A successfully created session can at any time be closed using
        org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Close, or may at any time be closed
        by the portal implementation, which will be signalled via
        :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session::Closed`.

        Supported keys in the @options vardict include:

        * ``handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the @handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request` documentation for
          more information about the @handle.

        * ``session_handle_token`` (``s``)

          A string that will be used as the last element of the session handle. Must be a valid
          object path element. See the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session` documentation for
          more information about the session handle.

        The following results get returned via the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Request::Response` signal:

        * ``session_handle`` (``s``)

          The session handle. An object path for the
          :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session` object representing the created
          session.

          .. note::
            The ``session_handle`` is an object path that was erroneously implemented
            as ``s``. For backwards compatibility it will remain this type.

        This method was added in version 2 of this interface.

        StateChanged:
        @session_handle: Object path for the :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Session` object
        @state: Vardict with information about the session state

        The StateChanged signal is sent to active monitoring sessions when
        the session state changes.

        When the session state changes to 'Query End', clients with active monitoring
        sessions are expected to respond by calling
        org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit.QueryEndResponse() within a second
        of receiving the StateChanged signal. They may call org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit.Inhibit()
        first to inhibit logout, to prevent the session from proceeding to the Ending state.

        The following information may get returned in the @state vardict:

        * ``screensaver-active`` (``b``)

          Whether the screensaver is active.

        * ``session-state`` (``u``)

          The state of the session. This member is new in version 3.

          - ``1``: Running
          - ``2``: Query End
          - ``3``: Ending
