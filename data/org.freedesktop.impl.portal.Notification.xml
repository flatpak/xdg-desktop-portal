      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Notification:
      @short_description: Notification portal backend interface

      This notification interface lets sandboxed applications
      send and withdraw notifications.

      This documentation describes version 2 of this interface.
  -->
  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Notification">
    <!--
        AddNotification:
        @app_id: App id of the application
        @id: Application-provided ID for this notification
        @notification: Vardict with the serialized notification

        Sends a notification.

        The ID can be used to later withdraw the notification.
        If the application reuses the same ID without withdrawing,
        the notification is updated with the new one. It's possible
        to set ``show-as-new`` hint in the ``display-hint`` property
        to animate replacing the notification instead of updating it.

        The format of the @notification is the same as for
        :ref:`org.freedesktop.portal.Notification.AddNotification`.

        Since version 2, the icon property never uses the ``bytes`` option.
