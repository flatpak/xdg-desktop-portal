      org.freedesktop.portal.CredentialsX:
      @short_description: Credentials portal

      The credentials portal allows applications to request web
      credentials. The user will be prompted to select a credential,
      which the application can use to authenticate.

      Currently the only supported credential type is WebAuthn
      credentials.

      Credentials are created by CreateCredential() and retrieved
      by GetCredential().

      The D-Bus interface for the credentials portal is available
      under the bus name org.freedesktop.portal.Credentials and the
      object path /org/freedesktop/portal/credentials.

      This documentation describes a pre-release version of this
      interface.
