      org.freedesktop.portal.ProxyResolver:
      @short_description: Proxy information

      The ProxyResolver interface provides network proxy information to sandboxed
      applications. It is not a portal in the strict sense, since it does not involve
      user interaction. Applications are expected to use this interface indirectly,
      via a library API such as the GLib GProxyResolver interface.

      This documentation describes version 2 of this interface.

      If pac_url exists, it should be the only setting read;
      if it doesn't, the associated dbus properties should be utilized.

        Lookup:
        @uri: Destination to connect to
        @proxies: List of proxy uris

        Looks up which proxy to use to connect to @uri. The returned
        proxy uri are of the form ``protocol://[user[:password] AT host:port``.
        The protocol can be ``http``, ``rtsp``, ``socks`` or another proxying
        protocol. ``direct://`` is used when no proxy is needed.

        This is a convenience wrapper over reading the PAC file or the other
        portal settings, in that order of priority from highest to lowest. It
        is provided to ensure backwards compatibility with older versions
        of GLib.
