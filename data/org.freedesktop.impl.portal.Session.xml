      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session:
      @short_description: Shared session interface

      The Session interface is shared by all portal interfaces that involve
      long lived sessions.  When a method that creates a session is called, the
      reply will include a session handle (i.e. object path) for a Session
      object, which will stay alive for the duration of the session.

      The portal can abort the interaction by calling
      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session.Close2() on the Session object.

      This documentation describes version 2 of this interface.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session">

    <!--
        Close:

        Close the session.

        This method is deprecated since version 2 of this interface and will no
        longer by called by xdg-desktop-portal.

        * ``voluntary`` (``b``)

          A boolean that indicates whether the app voluntarily called Close on
          the session. If false, the session was closed by the portal.

        Since version 2.
