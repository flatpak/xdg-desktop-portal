      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session:
      @short_description: Shared session interface

      The Session interface is shared by all portal interfaces that involve
      long lived sessions.  When a method that creates a session is called, the
      reply will include a session handle (i.e. object path) for a Session
      object, which will stay alive for the duration of the session.

      The portal can abort the interaction by calling
      org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Session.Close() on the Session object.
