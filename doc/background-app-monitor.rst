Background Apps Monitoring API
==============================

In addition to managing the regular interfaces that sandboxed applications
use to interfact with the host system, xdg-desktop-portals also monitors
running applications without an active window - if the portal backend
provides an implementation of the Background portal.

This API can be used by host system services to provide rich interfaces to
manage background running applications.
