Pull Requests & Issues
======================

XDG Desktop Portal uses GitHub to
`discuss new portals and features <https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/discussions>`_,
`track issues <https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues>`_ and
`take contributions <https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pulls>`_.

Please be kind and patient as code reviews can be long and be minutious, issue
triage takes effort and everyone has limited time and resources.

Before developing features or fixing bugs, please make sure you have done the
following:

- Your code is not on the ``main`` branch of your fork.
- The code has been tested.
- All commit messages are properly formatted and commits squashed where
  appropriate.
- You have included updates to all appropriate documentation.
