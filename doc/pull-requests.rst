Submitting Pull Requests
========================

XDG Desktop Portal uses GitHub pull requests to review contributions. Please be
kind and patient as code reviews can be long and be minutious.

Before developing features or fixing bugs, please make sure you have done the
following:

- Your code is not on the ``main`` branch of your fork.
- The code has been tested.
- All commit messages are properly formatted and commits squashed where
  appropriate.
- You have included updates to all appropriate documentation.
