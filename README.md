# XDG Desktop Portal

A portal frontend service for [Flatpak](http://www.flatpak.org) and other
desktop containment frameworks.

xdg-desktop-portal works by exposing a series of D-Bus interfaces known as
_portals_ under a well-known name (`org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`) and object
path (`/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop`).

The portal interfaces include APIs for file access, opening URIs, printing
and others.

Documentation for the available D-Bus interfaces can be found
[here](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/).

## Version Numbering

xdg-desktop-portal uses even minor version numbers for stable versions, and odd
minor version numbers for unstable versions. During an unstable version cycle,
portal APIs can make backward incompatible changes, meaning that applications
should only depend on APIs defined in stable xdg-desktop-portal versions in
production.

## Building xdg-desktop-portal

xdg-desktop-portal depends on GLib and Flatpak.
To build the documentation, you will need xmlto and the docbook stylesheets.

## Using Portals

Flatpak grants sandboxed applications _talk_ access to names in the
org.freedesktop.portal.\* prefix. One possible way to use the portal APIs
is thus just to make D-Bus calls. For many of the portals, toolkits (e.g.
GTK) are expected to support portals transparently if you use suitable
high-level APIs.

To implement most portals, xdg-desktop-portal relies on a backend
that provides implementations of the org.freedesktop.impl.portal.\* interfaces.

Here are some examples of available backends:

- GTK [xdg-desktop-portal-gtk](http://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal-gtk)
- GNOME [xdg-desktop-portal-gnome](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/xdg-desktop-portal-gnome/)
- KDE [xdg-desktop-portal-kde](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde)
- LXQt [xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt](https://github.com/lxqt/xdg-desktop-portal-lxqt)
- Pantheon (elementary OS) [xdg-desktop-portal-pantheon](https://github.com/elementary/portals)
- wlroots [xdg-desktop-portal-wlr](https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr)
- Deepin [xdg-desktop-portal-dde](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/xdg-desktop-portal-dde)
- Xapp (Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce) [xdg-desktop-portal-xapp](https://github.com/linuxmint/xdg-desktop-portal-xapp)

## Design Considerations

There are several reasons for the frontend/backend separation of the portal
code:

- We want to have _native_ portal dialogs that match the session desktop (i.e.
  GTK dialogs for GNOME, Qt dialogs for KDE)
- One of the limitations of the D-Bus proxying in flatpak is that allowing a
  sandboxed app to talk to a name implicitly also allows it to talk to any other
  name owned by the same unique name. Therefore, sandbox-facing D-Bus APIs
  should generally be hosted on a dedicated bus connection. For portals, the
  frontend takes care of this for us.
- The frontend can handle all the interaction with _portal infrastructure_, such
  as the permission store and the document store, freeing the backends to focus
  on just providing a user interface.
- The frontend can also handle argument validation, and be strict about only
  letting valid requests through to the backend.

The portal apis are all following the pattern of an initial method call, whose
response returns an object handle for an _org.freedesktop.portal.Request_ object
that represents the portal interaction. The end of the interaction is done via a
_Response_ signal that gets emitted on that object. This pattern was chosen over
a simple method call with return, since portal APIs are expected to show dialogs
and interact with the user, which may well take longer than the maximum method
call timeout of D-Bus. Another advantage is that the caller can cancel an
ongoing interaction by calling the _Cancel_ method on the request object.

One consideration for deciding the shape of portal APIs is that we want them to
'hide' behind existing library APIs where possible, to make it as easy as
possible to have apps use them _transparently_. For example, the OpenFile portal
is working well as a backend for the GtkFileChooserNative API.

When it comes to files, we need to be careful to not let portal APIs subvert the
limited filesystem view that apps have in their sandbox. Therefore, files should
only be passed into portal APIs in one of two forms:

- As a document ID referring to a file that has been exported in the document
  portal
- As an open fd. The portal can work its way back to a file path from the fd,
  and passing an fd proves that the app inside the sandbox has access to the
  file to open it.

When it comes to processes, passing PIDs around is not useful in a sandboxed
world where apps are likely in their own PID namespace. And passing PIDs from
inside the sandbox is problematic, since the app can just lie.

## System Integration

### D-Bus Activation Environment

xdg-desktop-portal and its portal backends are activatable D-Bus services.
This means that they inherit environment variables from the
"activation environment" maintained by either `systemd --user`
(on systems that use systemd) or `dbus-daemon` (on systems that do not).
They do not inherit environment variables from the GUI environment or
from the shell, unless some component of the overall system takes
responsibility for taking the necessary environment variables from the
GUI environment and sending them to `systemd` or `dbus-daemon` to be
added to the activation environment.

In integrated desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE Plasma, and in
OS distributions with a high level of integration, this should be done
automatically by desktop environment or OS infrastructure.

Variables that might need to be propagated in this way include, but are
not limited to:

- `DISPLAY`
- `PATH`
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
- `XAUTHORITY`
- `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`
- `XDG_DATA_DIRS`

In environments that are assembled out of individual components by
the user, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that this system
integration has been done, for example by using
[dbus-update-activation-environment(1)][dbus-update-activation-environment]
or [`systemctl --user import-environment VARâ€¦`][systemctl].

### Desktop Environment Requirements

The display manager or GUI environment is responsible for setting
`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` to an appropriate value.

The GUI environment should provide a
[portal configuration file][portals.conf] with a name based on its
`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, to select appropriate portal backends.

The GUI environment should arrange for its required portal backend or
backends to be installed as dependencies (possibly as optional
dependencies, if it is packaged in a loosely-coupled operating system).

In environments that are assembled out of individual components by
the user, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that this system
integration has been done.
