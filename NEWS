xdg-desktop-portal 0.10
=======================

This version of xdg-desktop-portal contains the xdg-document-portal
that used to be shipped by flatpak. The code was moved to
xdg-desktop-portal as a first step towards being used by
snappy. Additionally having the two related portals delivered together
makes it easier to implement new features that rely on changes to
both portals.

The two versions of the document portal are fully compatible, but the
package files will conflict with older versions of flatpak, so
packagers will have to pick one version. Following this there will be
a new release of unstable flatpak with the document portal removed,
and a release of the stable branch (0.10) that has a configure
option to disable the document portal.

Additionally, this release contains a new screencast and remote
desktop portal based on PipeWire.

Major changes in this versions:

 * Import permission store from flatpak
 * Import document portal from flatpak
 * Add remote desktop portal
 * Add screencast portal
 * Add "interactive" mode to screenshot portal
 * file-chooser: Don't return document paths for paths the application has direct access to
 * Handle newer version of bubblewrap
 * New abstraction for application info, supporting multiple sandbox technologies
 * Add basic test suite
